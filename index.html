            <p>I am a frontend developer passionate about building websites that are lean, beautiful, and accessible. I love to learn about design and typography as well as new tools to improve the user experience. I am detail-oriented and willing to keep hacking at a problem until I find a way through or around it.</p>
            <p>Languages & Skills: I speak HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently learning Svelte and React. I am comfortable using Git and the command line.</p>

            <h3>Random Seinfeld: <a href="https://randomseinfeld.com/" target="_blank">Live</a> | <a href="https://github.com/shreggz/random-seinfeld" target="_blank">Code</a></h3>
            <p>A webapp that randomly selects an episode of Seinfeld and displays information about it, including its title and description. It also allows users to filter episodes by season. The design is mobile-first, and the core functionality is implemented in JavaScript. The site is deployed with GitHub Pages.</p>
            <p>I built this tool for Seinfeld fans such as myself to easily find random episodes to rewatch while avoiding specific seasons.</p>

            <h3>Personal Site: <a href="https://sridharbhagavathula.com/" target="_blank">Live</a> | <a href="https://github.com/shreggz/personal-site" target="_blank">Code</a></h3>
            <p>A simple yet elegant grid-based layout with links to all of my work. The HTML is semantic and the site is fully responsive. There is a little bit of JavaScript for a silly excuse generator.</p>
            <p>The main problem I ran into was the size of the fonts. Because my design was heavily typographic, I needed to serve three different files which totaled to ~1500kbs&mdash;much too large. To solve this, I first converted the <code>.ttf</code> files to <code>.woff2</code>. Then I used <a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2418" target="_blank">pyftsubset</a> to cull the number of glyphs in each file down to only those I needed. After that they totaled just 47kbs, which drastically improved the page's loading speed.</p>
            <p>This project was a great way to learn how to use tools such as Lighthosue and Yellow Lab to diagnose and fix performance issues without sacrificing the original design.</p>

            <h3>Drag-N-Draw: <a href="https://shreggz.github.io/drag-n-draw/" target="_blank">Live</a> | <a href="https://github.com/shreggz/drag-n-draw" target="_blank">Code</a></h3>
            <p>A pixelart sketchpad made with vanilla JavaScript. The pixels are colored in by hovering rather than clicking because I wanted to simulate the effect of an Etch-A-Sketch&mdash;that is, you have to be strategic about how you enter and exit the board. The skeuomorphic design evokes a retro arcade game.</p>
            <p>This project was primarily an exercise in learning and implementing JavaScript fundamentals such as event handlers and DOM manipulation.</p>

            <h3>Dupe Checker: <a href="https://shreggz.github.io/dupe-checker/" target="_blank">Demo (work in progress)</a> | <a href="https://github.com/shreggz/dupe-checker" target="_blank">Code</a></h3>
            <p>A webapp that scans your text for duplicated words and phrases so you can avoid sounding repetitive in formal writing. I am building this because it is the kind of app I would like to use when editing my own documents.</p>
            <p>This project is a work in progress, but I have made the demo live in the spirit of <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up" target="_blank">working with the garage door up.</a> I am currently working out the logic with JavaScript and plan to use Svelte for the prototype.</p>
