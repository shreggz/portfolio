    <main>
        <p>I am a frontend developer passionate about building websites that are polished, lean, and beautiful. I love to learn about design and typography as well as new tools to improve page speed and accessibility. I am detail-oriented and willing to keep hacking at a problem until I find a way through or around it.</p>
        <p>Languages & Skills: I speak HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently learning Svelte. I am comfortable using Git and the command line.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Personal Site</h3>
        <p>A simple yet elegant two-column page with links to all of my work and personal projects. The HTML is semantic and the site is fully responsive. There is a little bit of JavaScript for a silly excuse generator. Because my design is heavily typographic, I used <a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2418" target="_blank">pyftsubset</a> to reduce the number of glyphs in my font files and improve the loading speed. It scores ~99/100 in performance tests via PageSpeed Insights, Yellow Lab Test, and DebugBear.</p>

        <h3>Drag-N-Draw</h3>
        <p>A pixelart sketchpad made with vanilla JS. The pixels are colored in by hovering rather than clicking because I wanted to simulate the effect of an Etch-A-Sketch; that is, you have to be strategic about how you enter and exit the board. I went with a skeumorphic design to evoke a retro arcade game.</p>

        <h3>Dupe Checker</h3>
        <p>A webapp that checks for duplicated words and phrases in a body of text. It is intended for writers who like to sweat the details. You can toggle the minumum number of letters that count (to stop words such as "the" from rendering your list useless). You can then edit your text in the browser and recheck it. I am building the kind of app that I want to use when I am writing. It is still in progress, but I have made the demo live in the spirit of <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up" target="_blank">"working with the garage door up."</a></p>
